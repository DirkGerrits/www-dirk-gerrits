  <li><p><strong>2008 -- 2013:</strong> PhD student<br/>
      <a href="http://w3.tue.nl/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, the Netherlands
      <div class="longnote"><ul>
        <li>Performed practical experiments and theoretical research into
          robot push planning and dynamic map labeling, resulting in
          <a href="/publications/">publications</a> in various
          international journals and conferences.</li> 

        <li>Graded homework and taught tutorials (mini-lectures) in Bachelor

        <li><strong>Project work for <a href="http://assembleon.com/">Assembl√©on Netherlands B.V.</a></strong><br/>
          (Part of "Kenniswerkersregeling" project KWR09598 "SUPREME".)
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced the computation time for a part of the optimization
            software for existing pick & place machines from hours to seconds.</li>
            <li>Developed prototype optimization software for a new line of
            pick & place machines.</li>
            <li>Used simulations with prototype to recommend a design for
            the new line of machines; 20--60% projected gain in production
            speed compared to previous machines.</li>
