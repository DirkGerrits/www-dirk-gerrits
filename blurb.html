Hi.  My name is <span id="my-name">Dirk Gerrits</span>, and I'm a
programmer and computer scientist.  My passion?

<br/>

<span id="my-passion">Optimization</span>
<hr/>
<em>To design and implement <span class="highlight">algorithms</span>
that compute the <span class="highlight">best</span> possible solution
to <span class="highlight">real-world</span> problems.</em>
<hr/>

<br/>

Pursuing this passion in academia, industry, and spare time I've
acquired a diverse set of skills and interests that I continue to hone
and expand with an insatiable hunger for knowledge.

<!---
Both a mathematician and a programmer at heart, I'm someone who can
neither practice without theory, nor theorize without practice.  My
intellectual interests span across
<span style="color:#377eb8;">computer science</span>, 
as well as parts of
<span style="color:#4daf4a;">mathematics</span>
and 
<span style="color:#984ea3;">physics</span>.  
From algorithms and data structures, to visualization, game
development, and programming languages, to geometry, statistics, and
orbital mechanics. 

I'm a visual learner who strives for simplicity...
